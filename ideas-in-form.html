After deciding the concept, I've been focusing on what specific question I want to ask and how should that been experienced by my audience. 
          <br>
<br>
          My question toward the concept

<br><br>

In the time when we shifting our life into the virtual space, our definition to the land is introduced into that virtual space. Does the land in the virtual space has a similar value as in our physical world (home, form, property)? Do people also marginized in the virtual space as in the present reality? 
          <br><br>

KEY WORDS: land value | property | cyber space | ownership | time | cyber security

Concept
        <br><br>
          
My idea was more focusing on the exchange chain of property. By defining face as a identification and a property, I asked the audience to trade their money with their cyber privacy. This is a choice to use money buy a physical print and rights for not showing their face online or do not pay the money but show their faces for the public. 
          <br><br>
          
          Problems
          <br><br>
          
         From feedbacks, this workflow is 1.not so clear. 2.it is not so natural to people to get involved into the work, they might not come close and feel uncomfortable with the whole experience. 3. the work is better illustrated in physical form rather than a virtual interaction, it is hard for the audience to catch my idea.

Concept          <br>
<br>
After the storyboarding, I feel the exchange form can be keeped but in a different way to represent. My first intention is to create a scale that can directly show the trade system. The scale are made by cardboard covered by all the proof of ownership of the land. On one polar of the scale is my personal information and my credit card. On the other hand is some portals that means electricity, concrete. Those are things that used for physical and virtual space. 
<br><br>

KEY WORDS: trade | ownership | land value | cyber value | portals

          After making this simgle scale, I've been thinking to create multiple scales and put them in different locations. The things on the two polars can be other things such as body, physical objects, digital account and memories. So I start to create a space that users can trade things on one hand and then something would happen next. Currently it would be a short video that tell a story about power and space. That lead me to the next part, the digital representation.

             Problems and feedbacks
             
                       <br><br>

          
First, a great thank to my peers give me a lot of helpful feedbacks on my physical prototype. One of the most useful comments I got is "instead of an interactive body, creating a space that is interactive feels more relavent to my subject." And some other peers also pointed out that make use of the space feels more interesting and relevant. I think that is the critical point because all the time I've been focusing on the trading and system of value. Why does that important? What is the space? In other aspect, who is the audience? I think that must be crucial to figure that out.

        After Britain's first industrial revolution, a large number of immigrants poured into the city. Engels's book “The Condition of the Working-Class in England From Personal Observation and Authentic Sources” discusses in detail the life of Britain's underground cities. 
        <br><br>
          <br><br>
        A large influx of immigrants moves into Beijing. They can not live in their own houses, living underground has become their only option. The basement became a flexible home for these outsiders because of distance and money.

          The value of space is changing its meaning because of our needs. The living environment in the example meets people's expectations of a simple life. And the younger generation made similar choices as them for a variety of reasons. Because of the price and distance, some people will share their living space with strangers to save money, shared housing is now a short version of the home to meet the needs of the younger generation. Capsule hotel was born under the minimalist concept. It has to be said that the pace of urban and social change exceeds the level of people's wealth growth rapidly. The average house price in Beijing is 63,000 yuan per square meter. The average monthly wage in Beijing in 2019 is 11,715 yuan a month. If you want to buy a 100-square-meter home, a person with a normal salary will need to work for 45 years to pay off the mortgage in full, which is not considering interest and inflation. The average price of renting a house is 7,600 yuan, which accounts for more than 50% of monthly wages. Getting material satisfaction has become a bubble for young people who don't depend on their families. The virtual world has gradually become the spiritual need of workers in the new era. The need for a sense of security in private space slowly shifted to the virtual world. 
          <br><br>
          <br><br>
          A Virtual Future 
          <br><br>
          When we deplete the value of the physical world, the spirit becomes our main concern. The expectation existed in physical space were transferred to virtual. Security, privacy, freedom, and our need for private space cannot be satisfied in the physical world. Virtual space has become new spiritual support. Search engines, web video conferencing, remote sensing sex (naked chat, etc.), webcasts, electronic warfare make all reality digital. The world has a simultaneous time structure, social revolution is also accelerating. After leaving the primitive state of natural existence, what people's needs become? Back in the day, people are panicking, nervous, fearful, depressed about this uncertainty. Instability accounts for the main component. The root cause of this problem is the contradiction between nature and unnatural. People need a safe and stable space, just as in reality, people need a stable accommodation environment. Stay away from surveillance, have the right to freedom. But now the virtual world seems to be an extension of the real world. We need to use the money to buy the right to use cyberspace, such as iCloud. It's like buying a house in reality. People need to sacrifice their free time to work in exchange for free space. This form of transformation is also a remake of our society. Perhaps we also need to buy freedom in the future VR world, in the unit of measurement of time to achieve our freedom. Hide your actions and traces from the virtual society. Such space is luxurious, but also contradictory. It symbolizes the contradiction between people's need for self and unstable cyberspace. Can we be free in this virtual space? Can our sense of security be obtained from here? This is the question I want to challenge.

          One example is Ryoji Ikeda’s work data.tron (2019). It is part of the project “datamatics,” a series of experiments that explore questions both physical and mathematical. This long-term program of moving image, sculpture, sound, and new media takes data as its theme and material exploring the ways in which abstracted views of reality—data—are used to encode, understand, and control the world. Visitors experience the cast universe of data in the infinite between 0 and 1.

          Another example is Lu Yang’s work The Great Adventure of Material World. The interactive game explores themes of matter, the consciousness contained by matter, and how one might abandon matter to find the essence of the self. The protagonist, Material World Knight, takes the viewer on an adventure through a diverse array of material worlds. These worlds are interspersed with characters from Lu Yang’s previous works. They appear as guides or protagonists of specific realms, traveling together with the viewer to explore the artist’s universe.
          <br>
          <br>
          During the adventure, the protagonist upgrades his weapons and equipment. The most important weapon os the Vajra Spear, as in myth the Vajra is the hardest object in the universe, able to cut through everything physical. By slicing through all matter, the protagonist reveals the essence of the material world. However, even as he soars through the universe on a manned, transforming robot and destroys all physical obstacles, obstacles of emotion and desire remain indestructible.

          In the angle of physical space, Agnes Denes' work of Wheatfield – A Confrontation, 1982 is an example to challenge audience's mind in a special location. In the act of protest against global warming and economic inequality, she planted an expansive wheatfield in a landfill created after the construction of the Twin Towers, in downtown Manhattan, in 1982.

The field stretched two acres and was planted and harvested by the artist herself in the summer of 1982. It is planting a field of wheat on a property worth $4.5 billion created a powerful irony. The field referred to mismanagement, waste, ecological concerns, and world hunger. The act drew attention to the world’s misplaced priorities. 
          Denes deliberately selected the location due to its proximity to Wall Street, a financial hub and home of the stock exchange where goods such as wheat are traded. This concurrently referenced on the economy of the world as well as the state of the earth itself.
         <br><br>
          Wheatfield was a symbol, a universal concept; it represented food, energy, commerce, world trade, and economics.it referred to mismanagement, waste, world hunger and ecological concerns. It called attention to our misplaced priorities.

Artforum writer Brain Sholis noted both the simple generosity of the project and that Wheatfield- A Confrontation and can be understood as one of the first occasions on which Denes worked on a scale large enough and in a location public enough to suit her outsized ambition. The intervention represented, in the artist’s words, nothing less than ‘food, energy, commerce, world trade, economics.
