After deciding the concept, I've been focusing on what specific question I want to ask and how should that been experienced by my audience. 
          <br>
<br>
          My question toward the concept

<br><br>

In the time when we shifting our life into the virtual space, our definition to the land is introduced into that virtual space. Does the land in the virtual space has a similar value as in our physical world (home, form, property)? Do people also marginized in the virtual space as in the present reality? 
          <br><br>

KEY WORDS: land value | property | cyber space | ownership | time | cyber security

Concept
        <br><br>
          
My idea was more focusing on the exchange chain of property. By defining face as a identification and a property, I asked the audience to trade their money with their cyber privacy. This is a choice to use money buy a physical print and rights for not showing their face online or do not pay the money but show their faces for the public. 
          <br><br>
          
          Problems
          <br><br>
          
         From feedbacks, this workflow is 1.not so clear. 2.it is not so natural to people to get involved into the work, they might not come close and feel uncomfortable with the whole experience. 3. the work is better illustrated in physical form rather than a virtual interaction, it is hard for the audience to catch my idea.

Concept          <br>
<br>
After the storyboarding, I feel the exchange form can be keeped but in a different way to represent. My first intention is to create a scale that can directly show the trade system. The scale are made by cardboard covered by all the proof of ownership of the land. On one polar of the scale is my personal information and my credit card. On the other hand is some portals that means electricity, concrete. Those are things that used for physical and virtual space. 
<br><br>

KEY WORDS: trade | ownership | land value | cyber value | portals

          After making this simgle scale, I've been thinking to create multiple scales and put them in different locations. The things on the two polars can be other things such as body, physical objects, digital account and memories. So I start to create a space that users can trade things on one hand and then something would happen next. Currently it would be a short video that tell a story about power and space. That lead me to the next part, the digital representation.

             Problems and feedbacks
             
                       <br><br>

          
First, a great thank to my peers give me a lot of helpful feedbacks on my physical prototype. One of the most useful comments I got is "instead of an interactive body, creating a space that is interactive feels more relavent to my subject." And some other peers also pointed out that make use of the space feels more interesting and relevant. I think that is the critical point because all the time I've been focusing on the trading and system of value. Why does that important? What is the space? In other aspect, who is the audience? I think that must be crucial to figure that out.

        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; margin-top:40px;">
The digital representation follows the physical interaction. The video as a sorce of outcomes after the audience trade their properties. This is a video that shows the power and ownership. Power as a representation of ownership has always played a role in nature. I used different scale of perspectives to illustrate the same system in human species. 
       <br><br>

KEY WORDS: power | territory | conflict | exclusive | ownership | protection

Feedbacks and reflection
          
          <br><br>
The video is too vague for the audience to related those concepts together. When it comes to space and ownership, a physical object can better illustrate my subject. The whole interaction is not possible for the audience to generate the question that I asked at the begining. And the perspection of seeing it is also directional. The work need to be free for the audience to think and view. I would reconsider the media and the context to better focus on the space ownership and its determination. One direction is to use camera vision and machine learning to recognize the object value, the other direction is to rethink the form of physical body.
