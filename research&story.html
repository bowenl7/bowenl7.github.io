Interests and confusion are the intuitive feedbacks that humans generate more than ever when facing future technology and current social problems. From our perspective, the "unnatural" caused by the advancement of bioengineering and computer technology gradually changing our perception of things and our behaviors. Freud's concept of "psychological man" is being redefined. With this change, people's needs have also profoundly changed. With our change, the value of land and space will also go over the new critical points to obtain new interpretations and functions because of our needs. When we overstep Darwin’s theory of evolution, space also surpassed its original attributes and came to a new dimension. At the tipping point between the end phase of the old mankind and the beginning of the future, the value of space and our needs will inevitably conflict. The space value (physical space and virtual space) need to be altered critically under our new needs. And this change has a deep relationship with the value we give to space.
<br>
<br>
How did the value of space change?<br>
What is our need for space?<br><br>

In our social system, the simplest and most obvious definition of space is the land. How much land a person owns can show his class and wealth level. When land is linked to the value of wealth, owning more land and space is the simplest and most crude way to satisfy people's desires.

Gengdu—The Culture of Farming and Studying in Ancient Chinese Society
<br><br>

The land value was endowed with the meaning of guaranteeing wealth and maintaining class in ancient China. This is the deep value that ancient people gave to the land other than the land cultivation. As a traditional agricultural country, China has always had stability in its land policy. How is the land used as a security mechanism for class maintenance? In ancient China, the official-based system is the main structure in society. Success depends on whether or not a person can become a government official. The selection and appointment of officials through the imperial examination is the only way. There is no way to guarantee that one's child will pass the imperial examination. Failing is a high probability event. If a family wants to maintain its class continuously, one way is to increase the probability by having more new births. And this is not even close to success. To allow wealth to be passed on for hundreds of years, farming and schooling have become the best choice. A wealthy family would purchase a large amount of land to collect the rent of it so that the original value can be converted into continuous funds that can provide their children and grandchildren to study. This is a wheel that would never stop. The value of the land is firmly bound to the value of its production. It will not fall and is very stable. In ancient society, the land satisfies people's needs for a stable class. The emperor would declare to the world that he owns all the land as his properties, and that land is his home. It was the projection of one’s power, the real ability a man can manipulate in society.

        The difference between computer language and human language is always the direction I am interested in. When computer language analyzes the semantics of human language, the current technical level cannot allow the computer to correctly recognize and analyze the arbitrary meaning we want to express. This interesting difference and gap can create a lot of thinking space. The Toast2word project is a practical way that I am very interested in. And I also have my own views on the choice of the theme. I like to study the process of people learning a language. When learning a new language , People will first learn the emotional expression of this language, such as taboo language, such as I love you. This may be the commonality of human beings when expressing. We need a sense of empathy to build a bridge between languages. And this emotion expression is precisely the inner essence of a language. Teaching computers to speak taboo language, how to use emotional expression may be the easiest bridge between humans and computers. How to establish this emotional connection is the main direction I want to explore. Nonsense vocabulary can express a vague and unclear emotion in the form of sentences. The same is true for human poetry. So can computers produce sentences that make us empathize? Are their answers and emotional catharsis appropriate to us? I want to collect all kinds of words I like to expand the language library of the computer, including but not limited to taboo language. Let the computer add feedback to this picture in the form of question and answer and images. Maybe meme exists in this mixed form as we see from the internet.
