Interests and confusion are the intuitive feedbacks that humans generate more than ever when facing future technology and current social problems. From our perspective, the "unnatural" caused by the advancement of bioengineering and computer technology gradually changing our perception of things and our behaviors. Freud's concept of "psychological man" is being redefined. With this change, people's needs have also profoundly changed. With our change, the value of land and space will also go over the new critical points to obtain new interpretations and functions because of our needs. When we overstep Darwin’s theory of evolution, space also surpassed its original attributes and came to a new dimension. At the tipping point between the end phase of the old mankind and the beginning of the future, the value of space and our needs will inevitably conflict. The space value (physical space and virtual space) need to be altered critically under our new needs. And this change has a deep relationship with the value we give to space.
<br>
<br>
How did the value of space change?<br>
What is our need for space?<br><br>

In our social system, the simplest and most obvious definition of space is the land. How much land a person owns can show his class and wealth level. When land is linked to the value of wealth, owning more land and space is the simplest and most crude way to satisfy people's desires.

Gengdu—The Culture of Farming and Studying in Ancient Chinese Society
<br><br>

The land value was endowed with the meaning of guaranteeing wealth and maintaining class in ancient China. This is the deep value that ancient people gave to the land other than the land cultivation. As a traditional agricultural country, China has always had stability in its land policy. How is the land used as a security mechanism for class maintenance? In ancient China, the official-based system is the main structure in society. Success depends on whether or not a person can become a government official. The selection and appointment of officials through the imperial examination is the only way. There is no way to guarantee that one's child will pass the imperial examination. Failing is a high probability event. If a family wants to maintain its class continuously, one way is to increase the probability by having more new births. And this is not even close to success. To allow wealth to be passed on for hundreds of years, farming and schooling have become the best choice. A wealthy family would purchase a large amount of land to collect the rent of it so that the original value can be converted into continuous funds that can provide their children and grandchildren to study. This is a wheel that would never stop. The value of the land is firmly bound to the value of its production. It will not fall and is very stable. In ancient society, the land satisfies people's needs for a stable class. The emperor would declare to the world that he owns all the land as his properties, and that land is his home. It was the projection of one’s power, the real ability a man can manipulate in society.

Heritage of The New Era

        <br><br>
          
When Chinese society transforms from a traditional agricultural lifestyle to modern industrial society, land cannot pass on the mainstream wealth of society. People need a new inheritance system. The value of land has faded the color of the class under this wave of social change and demand change. Although at the beginning of the reform and opening up (the Chinese Economic Reform), the land has a deep imprint of maintaining the family and real estate. With the change of policy and constant migration all around the country, the purchase of real estate is unable to meet people's original demand for land and space. The cost of buying a house is too high, but the benefits are getting less and less. When the average rental rate of return on a home is only 1.5% a year, land can no longer meet people's investment needs. People will hug more risky, more returnable financial investments and wealth exchange, such as marriage. The value of land has also become a space to meet the needs of family life and provide safety in this social change.

          What Now
          
          <br><br>
          Although the value of the investment has decreased, owning a house with more space is a benchmark for class and wealth at the social level. Under the premise that the government has limited the life span of a property by 70 years, the physical living space purchased with money shows a person's level of wealth and the free space he can control. The stronger the ability, the greater the free space. Compared to the crowded public space with numerous surveillance cameras, owning a private space is a luxury.

        After Britain's first industrial revolution, a large number of immigrants poured into the city. Engels's book “The Condition of the Working-Class in England From Personal Observation and Authentic Sources” discusses in detail the life of Britain's underground cities. 
        <br><br>
          <br><br>
        A large influx of immigrants moves into Beijing. They can not live in their own houses, living underground has become their only option. The basement became a flexible home for these outsiders because of distance and money.

          The value of space is changing its meaning because of our needs. The living environment in the example meets people's expectations of a simple life. And the younger generation made similar choices as them for a variety of reasons. Because of the price and distance, some people will share their living space with strangers to save money, shared housing is now a short version of the home to meet the needs of the younger generation. Capsule hotel was born under the minimalist concept. It has to be said that the pace of urban and social change exceeds the level of people's wealth growth rapidly. The average house price in Beijing is 63,000 yuan per square meter. The average monthly wage in Beijing in 2019 is 11,715 yuan a month. If you want to buy a 100-square-meter home, a person with a normal salary will need to work for 45 years to pay off the mortgage in full, which is not considering interest and inflation. The average price of renting a house is 7,600 yuan, which accounts for more than 50% of monthly wages. Getting material satisfaction has become a bubble for young people who don't depend on their families. The virtual world has gradually become the spiritual need of workers in the new era. The need for a sense of security in private space slowly shifted to the virtual world. 
          <br><br>
          <br><br>
          A Virtual Future 
          <br><br>
          When we deplete the value of the physical world, the spirit becomes our main concern. The expectation existed in physical space were transferred to virtual. Security, privacy, freedom, and our need for private space cannot be satisfied in the physical world. Virtual space has become new spiritual support. Search engines, web video conferencing, remote sensing sex (naked chat, etc.), webcasts, electronic warfare make all reality digital. The world has a simultaneous time structure, social revolution is also accelerating. After leaving the primitive state of natural existence, what people's needs become? Back in the day, people are panicking, nervous, fearful, depressed about this uncertainty. Instability accounts for the main component. The root cause of this problem is the contradiction between nature and unnatural. People need a safe and stable space, just as in reality, people need a stable accommodation environment. Stay away from surveillance, have the right to freedom. But now the virtual world seems to be an extension of the real world. We need to use the money to buy the right to use cyberspace, such as iCloud. It's like buying a house in reality. People need to sacrifice their free time to work in exchange for free space. This form of transformation is also a remake of our society. Perhaps we also need to buy freedom in the future VR world, in the unit of measurement of time to achieve our freedom. Hide your actions and traces from the virtual society. Such space is luxurious, but also contradictory. It symbolizes the contradiction between people's need for self and unstable cyberspace. Can we be free in this virtual space? Can our sense of security be obtained from here? This is the question I want to challenge.

          One example is Ryoji Ikeda’s work data.tron (2019). It is part of the project “datamatics,” a series of experiments that explore questions both physical and mathematical. This long-term program of moving image, sculpture, sound, and new media takes data as its theme and material exploring the ways in which abstracted views of reality—data—are used to encode, understand, and control the world. Visitors experience the cast universe of data in the infinite between 0 and 1.

          Another example is Lu Yang’s work The Great Adventure of Material World. The interactive game explores themes of matter, the consciousness contained by matter, and how one might abandon matter to find the essence of the self. The protagonist, Material World Knight, takes the viewer on an adventure through a diverse array of material worlds. These worlds are interspersed with characters from Lu Yang’s previous works. They appear as guides or protagonists of specific realms, traveling together with the viewer to explore the artist’s universe.
          <br>
          <br>
          During the adventure, the protagonist upgrades his weapons and equipment. The most important weapon os the Vajra Spear, as in myth the Vajra is the hardest object in the universe, able to cut through everything physical. By slicing through all matter, the protagonist reveals the essence of the material world. However, even as he soars through the universe on a manned, transforming robot and destroys all physical obstacles, obstacles of emotion and desire remain indestructible.

          In the angle of physical space, Agnes Denes' work of Wheatfield – A Confrontation, 1982 is an example to challenge audience's mind in a special location. In the act of protest against global warming and economic inequality, she planted an expansive wheatfield in a landfill created after the construction of the Twin Towers, in downtown Manhattan, in 1982.

The field stretched two acres and was planted and harvested by the artist herself in the summer of 1982. It is planting a field of wheat on a property worth $4.5 billion created a powerful irony. The field referred to mismanagement, waste, ecological concerns, and world hunger. The act drew attention to the world’s misplaced priorities. 
          Denes deliberately selected the location due to its proximity to Wall Street, a financial hub and home of the stock exchange where goods such as wheat are traded. This concurrently referenced on the economy of the world as well as the state of the earth itself.
         <br><br>
          Wheatfield was a symbol, a universal concept; it represented food, energy, commerce, world trade, and economics.it referred to mismanagement, waste, world hunger and ecological concerns. It called attention to our misplaced priorities.

Artforum writer Brain Sholis noted both the simple generosity of the project and that Wheatfield- A Confrontation and can be understood as one of the first occasions on which Denes worked on a scale large enough and in a location public enough to suit her outsized ambition. The intervention represented, in the artist’s words, nothing less than ‘food, energy, commerce, world trade, economics.
