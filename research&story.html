Interests and confusion are the intuitive feedbacks that humans generate more than ever when facing future technology and current social problems. From our perspective, the "unnatural" caused by the advancement of bioengineering and computer technology gradually changing our perception of things and our behaviors. Freud's concept of "psychological man" is being redefined. With this change, people's needs have also profoundly changed. With our change, the value of land and space will also go over the new critical points to obtain new interpretations and functions because of our needs. When we overstep Darwin’s theory of evolution, space also surpassed its original attributes and came to a new dimension. At the tipping point between the end phase of the old mankind and the beginning of the future, the value of space and our needs will inevitably conflict. The space value (physical space and virtual space) need to be altered critically under our new needs. And this change has a deep relationship with the value we give to space.

<br>
How did the value of space change?<br>
What is our need for space?<br><br>

In our social system, the simplest and most obvious definition of space is the land. How much land a person owns can show his class and wealth level. When land is linked to the value of wealth, owning more land and space is the simplest and most crude way to satisfy people's desires.

Gengdu—The Culture of Farming and Studying in Ancient Chinese Society
<br><br>

The land value was endowed with the meaning of guaranteeing wealth and maintaining class in ancient China. This is the deep value that ancient people gave to the land other than the land cultivation. As a traditional agricultural country, China has always had stability in its land policy. How is the land used as a security mechanism for class maintenance? In ancient China, the official-based system is the main structure in society. Success depends on whether or not a person can become a government official. The selection and appointment of officials through the imperial examination is the only way. There is no way to guarantee that one's child will pass the imperial examination. Failing is a high probability event. If a family wants to maintain its class continuously, one way is to increase the probability by having more new births. And this is not even close to success. To allow wealth to be passed on for hundreds of years, farming and schooling have become the best choice. A wealthy family would purchase a large amount of land to collect the rent of it so that the original value can be converted into continuous funds that can provide their children and grandchildren to study. This is a wheel that would never stop. The value of the land is firmly bound to the value of its production. It will not fall and is very stable. In ancient society, the land satisfies people's needs for a stable class. The emperor would declare to the world that he owns all the land as his properties, and that land is his home. It was the projection of one’s power, the real ability a man can manipulate in society.

Heritage of The New Era

        <br><br>
          
When Chinese society transforms from a traditional agricultural lifestyle to modern industrial society, land cannot pass on the mainstream wealth of society. People need a new inheritance system. The value of land has faded the color of the class under this wave of social change and demand change. Although at the beginning of the reform and opening up (the Chinese Economic Reform), the land has a deep imprint of maintaining the family and real estate. With the change of policy and constant migration all around the country, the purchase of real estate is unable to meet people's original demand for land and space. The cost of buying a house is too high, but the benefits are getting less and less. When the average rental rate of return on a home is only 1.5% a year, land can no longer meet people's investment needs. People will hug more risky, more returnable financial investments and wealth exchange, such as marriage. The value of land has also become a space to meet the needs of family life and provide safety in this social change.

          What Now
          
          <br><br>
          Although the value of the investment has decreased, owning a house with more space is a benchmark for class and wealth at the social level. Under the premise that the government has limited the life span of a property by 70 years, the physical living space purchased with money shows a person's level of wealth and the free space he can control. The stronger the ability, the greater the free space. Compared to the crowded public space with numerous surveillance cameras, owning a private space is a luxury.
