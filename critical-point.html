      <h2 style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 20px; text-align:center; margin-top:100px;">Critical Point</h2>

      <div id="text">
        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%;margin-top: 60px;">
       In thermodynamics, a critical point (or critical state) is the end point of a phase equilibrium curve. The most prominent example is the liquid–vapor critical point, the end point of the pressure–temperature curve that designates conditions under which a liquid and its vapor can coexist. At higher temperatures, the gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. At the critical point, defined by a critical temperature Tc and a critical pressure pc, phase boundaries vanish. Other examples include the liquid–liquid critical points in mixtures.
      <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%;">
The existence of a critical point was first discovered by Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1822 and named by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1860 and Thomas Andrews in 1869. Cagniard showed that CO2 could be liquefied at 31 °C at a pressure of 73 atm, but not at a slightly higher temperature, even under pressures as high as 3000 atm.

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
         The existance of critical point is not just in the science area, it can also be defined in almost everything in our physical world. The critical point of our emotion, the critical point in death. Whether we are ill or not. If a bottle is full or empty. 
          <br><br>
          From dialectical point of view, an attribute of an object has two polarities, exist or not exist, to be or not to be, alive or dead, moving or staying. This idea is clear and helpful for people to give definition to an object, but it is not so accurate to 
          describe a current status. A sandpile's polarities can be a drop of sand and a whole sandpile, but what its changing status of becoming from a sand into a sandpile or vise verse?
          There is a critical point existing in between the two status. And the status for each happing existance are different. 
        
          <br>
          <br>
I want to make this critical point calculable so that we can define an existance almost for everything in the algorithm world. Rather than using 0 and 1 to define an status, I try to give different attributes to an object.

<h3 style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; margin-top:60px;">I Ching: The Book of Changes</h3>
<p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
  
  The I Ching or Yi Jing (Chinese: 易經; pinyin: Yìjīng, Mandarin pronunciation: [î tɕíŋ], usually translated as Book of Changes or Classic of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text and among the oldest of the Chinese classics. With more than two and a half millennia's worth of commentary and interpretation, the I Ching is an influential text read throughout the world, providing inspiration to the worlds of religion, philosophy, literature, and art. Originally a divination manual in the Western Zhou period (1000–750 BC), over the course of the Warring States period and early imperial period (500–200 BC) it was transformed into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the "Ten Wings". After becoming part of the Five Classics in the 2nd century BC, the I Ching was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East, and eventually took on an influential role in Western understanding of Eastern thought.
<br><br>
  The name Zhou yi literally means the "changes" (易; Yì) of the Zhou dynasty. The "changes" involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams, of their lines, or of the numbers obtained from the divination. Feng Youlan proposed that the word for "changes" originally meant "easy", as in a form of divination easier than the oracle bones, but there is little evidence for this. There is also an ancient folk etymology that sees the character for "changes" as containing the sun and moon, the cycle of the day. Modern Sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds, or from the content of a vessel being changed into another.
     <br>
  <br>
  
  Leibniz, who was corresponding with Jesuits in China, wrote the first European commentary on the I Ching in 1703, arguing that it proved the universality of binary numbers and theism, since the broken lines, the "0" or "nothingness", cannot become solid lines, the "1" or "oneness", without the intervention of God.
        
      <br>
  <br>
  After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, the I Ching was no longer part of mainstream Chinese political philosophy, but it maintained cultural influence as China's most ancient text. Borrowing back from Leibniz, Chinese writers offered parallels between the I Ching and subjects such as linear algebra and logic in computer science, aiming to demonstrate that ancient Chinese cosmology had anticipated Western discoveries.

<h3 style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; margin-top:60px;">Abandoned Christian Theme Park</h3>
        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
  
  Because nothing says fun, amusement and good times for all the family like bible studies, there was Holy Land USA, a Christian tourist attraction filled with religious exhibits in Waterbury, Connecticut between 1958 and 1984. At its height, Holy Land attracted up to 40,000 visitors a year to the park. Founded by John Baptist Greco, a Waterbury-based attorney.
<br><br>
  After Greco’s death, the park was left to the Religious Sisters of Filippini who still held weekly prayer meetings at the park for many years after its closure. It’s been suggested the nuns turned away volunteer efforts to restore the park for fear of liability lawsuits. In 1997 a group of boy scouts were allowed to repair the illuminated “Holy Land USA” and in 2008, the original 56-foot cross that was visible all over the city, was replaced with an illuminated 50-foot stainless steel one. Both later broke and have never been repaired. Year by year, Holy Land USA continued to be vandalised and fall further into disrepair.
     <br>
  <br>
  
 In 2010, the eerie remains of Holy Land USA turned truly sinister when news broke of the rape and murder of a 16 year-old girl inside the park. Finally this summer, after numerous failed attempts to sell the property, the Waterbury mayor and a car dealer jointly purchased Holy Land USA for $350,000.

 I was thinking how can we define a life of a space? Is it death or alive? Is the status of the space can be examined as our human body, like ill or not, infected or not infected?

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">

          I think the critical point of the space is defined or showed by its visitors and the percentage of the space usage. 
          I can digitalize the vague definition into caculable attributes. By using a visitor counting, the vividality of this space can be visualized through data. 
          And if the number is below a critical point which means the space is dying, the space can have some changes and more interaction with vistors that can automatically attract people to involve in the space or indicate the manageer of the space to change its usage.
