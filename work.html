The rain lightly slapped on the concrete floor, splashing the smell of mud. Walking on the slippery road, as if I resonated with all kinds of moving objects on the street. I sympathized with pedestrians who forget their raincoats and enjoyed feeling alive under the rain. My emotions also become sentimental with the heavy sky.

  The four years of studying in Seattle gave me a unique interest in the connection between man and nature. The environment we live in also affects the ties between people. Documenting and studying this relationship is a motivation for me to study at the University of Washington. This motivation is even more attractive to me than exploring mathematical operations. This is why I switched from mathematics to Photomedia. I fully practiced my art sense through photography, videography and installation and these practices deepened my desire to explore the question of how the environment affects people. What kind of interaction can make the audience feel the emotions better? What kind of environment can convey my conceptual idea? I need new forms of media to enrich my choices. Letting my works escape from the bright white art gallery has become my new motivation.

  How to build a bridge with my audience and let the audience become part of the work is the main question I will explore next. The work of my undergraduate professor Rebecca Cummins has deeply influenced the direction of my exploration path. Through a very natural form of interaction, various factors in nature are related to people. This simple and direct bridge is very beautiful. I draw a lot of energy from it and that become my navigator of inspiration and exploration. I hope that my audience can also enjoy this beauty, appreciate the reality of our lives on the earth, and maybe find a secret garden in the hustle and bustle city.

  This kind of interaction is not limited to people’s unilateral reception from natural. We can also send information vise versa. From the perspective of systematic theory, our environment will also change due to our behavior, giving us feedback. The ecosystem and the earth system are the same as us. What kind of communication channels and information dissemination methods should be shaped is the idea that has been lingering in my mind after the DFTC course. This may not only be human-computer interaction, but also a link between human computer and nature. As an artist and a designer, I want to design this kind of communication channel to explore people's naturalness and ego in the post-information age.

          I would like to use VR, installations and new kinds of sensors to create the bridge. Mixture of media would also be fun to play with. I don’t want to set much limitations to my expression media as I always do. The philosophical idea would be my priority.
