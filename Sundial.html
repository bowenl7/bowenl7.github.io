        "I love you, little maid,"<br>
Said the Sunbeam to the Shade,<br>
As all day long she shrank away before him;<br>
But at twilight, ere he died,<br>
She was weeping at his side;<br>
And he felt her tresses softly trailing o'er him.<br>

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
The word "photography" was created from the Greek roots φωτός (phōtos), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light" and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing", together meaning "drawing with light".
          <br>
          <br>
Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. It is a work of art to play with light either it is sunlight or artificial light. <br>
<br>
This process of documenting light is highly related to the sun, the emision core to send light on earth. Our eyes capture things by receiving the reflected information from them. And the shadow is the dark space that light can't reach out to. Our ancestors descover the relationship between the sun  and the shadow which can indicate time. They invented a simple method by documenting the shadow change drop on the platform overtime to track a day. Anthough the time accuracy is far lower than our method today, this interaction builds up a simple and beautiful bridge between us and the nature.

Other than today's digital photography, the precursor method for people to document our surrondings is slow and rough. The first group of photographers are actually painters and technologists. Before the chemical processing method was invented, painters would put their canvas on the window of the camera obscura to draw an accurate image that can best illustrate the correct vanishing points and depict a very realistic work. That was the days when realistic paints were on the top of billboard. When painters used this method, they were using their brushes to documenting the sunlight that reflected by objects.

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">

I want to document the sun itself which can be analog with the method of camera obsucra. By documenting and tracing the shadow of light, I am finishing a photo. And the image I take for the process can be a photo that document a photo. That would be interesting to try this out. So I started to do experiment.

</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%;">

It is very interesting to think about the media. I am drawing out the shape of the starbuck cup. The cup is a fluid media for me to depict a portrait of sun. The shape or the object can be anything. I'm starting to think about how can I play with the media and what kind of outcome of the drawing shadow can look like. I start to use a portable light shade or light filter to create paintings or sundial which is a drawing of the sun.

I draw the shades of the center circle to form a sunlight rainbow. The outcome painting will be uploaded soon. The sun drawing indicate my location and the time if I put it under the sun. It can be used as a portable sundial.

This natural bridge between human and the sun is beautiful. I like to explore more of the expressions of the drawing and also like to translate the natural language into other media.
