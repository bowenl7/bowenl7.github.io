          How to build a bridge with my audience and let the audience become part of the work is the main question I will explore next. The work of my undergraduate professor Rebecca Cummins has deeply influenced the direction of my exploration path. Through a very natural form of interaction, various factors in nature are related to people. This simple and direct bridge is very beautiful. I draw a lot of energy from it and that become my navigator of inspiration and exploration. I hope that my audience can also enjoy this beauty, appreciate the reality of our lives on the earth, and maybe find a secret garden in the hustle and bustle city.

          This kind of interaction is not limited to people’s unilateral reception from natural. We can also send information vise versa. From the perspective of systematic theory, our environment will also change due to our behavior, giving us feedback. The ecosystem and the earth system are the same as us. What kind of communication channels and information dissemination methods should be shaped is the idea that has been lingering in my mind after the DFTC course. This may not only be human-computer interaction, but also a link between human computer and nature. As an artist and a designer, I want to design this kind of communication channel to explore people's naturalness and ego in the post-information age.

          I would like to use VR, installations and new kinds of sensors to create the bridge. Mixture of media would also be fun to play with. I don’t want to set much limitations to my expression media as I always do. The philosophical idea would be my priority.

          When everyone is looking in the mirror, no one will notice the existence of the mirror.
