          The rain lightly slapped on the concrete floor, splashing the smell of mud. Walking on the slippery road, as if I resonated with all kinds of moving objects on the street. I sympathized with pedestrians who forget their raincoats and enjoyed feeling alive under the rain. My emotions also become sentimental with the heavy sky.

          The four years of studying in Seattle gave me a unique interest in the connection between man and nature. The environment we live in also affects the ties between people. Documenting and studying this relationship is a motivation for me to study at the University of Washington. This motivation is even more attractive to me than exploring mathematical operations. This is why I switched from mathematics to Photomedia. I fully practiced my art sense through photography, videography and installation and these practices deepened my desire to explore the question of how the environment affects people. What kind of interaction can make the audience feel the emotions better? What kind of environment can convey my conceptual idea? I need new forms of media to enrich my choices. Letting my works escape from the bright white art gallery has become my new motivation.

          How to build a bridge with my audience and let the audience become part of the work is the main question I will explore next. The work of my undergraduate professor Rebecca Cummins has deeply influenced the direction of my exploration path. Through a very natural form of interaction, various factors in nature are related to people. This simple and direct bridge is very beautiful. I draw a lot of energy from it and that become my navigator of inspiration and exploration. I hope that my audience can also enjoy this beauty, appreciate the reality of our lives on the earth, and maybe find a secret garden in the hustle and bustle city.

          This kind of interaction is not limited to people’s unilateral reception from natural. We can also send information vise versa. From the perspective of systematic theory, our environment will also change due to our behavior, giving us feedback. The ecosystem and the earth system are the same as us. What kind of communication channels and information dissemination methods should be shaped is the idea that has been lingering in my mind after the DFTC course. This may not only be human-computer interaction, but also a link between human computer and nature. As an artist and a designer, I want to design this kind of communication channel to explore people's naturalness and ego in the post-information age.

          I would like to use VR, installations and new kinds of sensors to create the bridge. Mixture of media would also be fun to play with. I don’t want to set much limitations to my expression media as I always do. The philosophical idea would be my priority.

As I said at the beginning of the semester, “when everyone is looking in the mirror, no one will notice the existence of the mirror”, I think this sentence glows throughout my exploration and practice of concepts in these months. In practice, I found that constant hands-on operations and timely feedbacks are crucial for me to clear and improve my ideas. From very conceptual ideas to actual output, especially when it comes to physical works, this process of continuous iterations and revisions has brought me a lot of improvement in many aspects. I have more detailed and in-depth thinking than the first personal statement.

In terms of the generation of concepts, finding answers from history and the past is an important source of inspiration for me. The continuous development of technology has fascinated me. With the evolution of technology, people's definitions and connections to the surrounding things have also changed. This semester I focus on using the existing or past methods to define our current determination of space ownership. I use the general determination standard to limit the ownership of different spaces to one dimension for display. This is the prologue of this topic. By examining history, the audience can discover the extensibility and systematic of ownership.

The space attracts me the most for my current situation. Who owns the space? What can proof a space is owned? These are the questions I ask all the time. Is the memory bounded with a space can show the ownership of this space? Can the documentation from the authority proof the space is private? All those thoughts are from my own situation of space ownership. My feelings and my self-examination of what I have owned. For the next step I would like to push this idea broadly into social scale. Not just for personal space but need to be a specific spot that has a conflict in ownership. Instead of using bare description, a signifier is needed in my upcoming works. This is the first chapter of space ownership.

Next step is the prediction and something that has not defined yet. What is the cyber ownership? How would the ownership looks like in the future? I think to answer those questions, first, I must define who we are and what material can we proof. As the over used technologies are widely spreading such as face recognition, fingerprint, bio-signal identification, the way of showing our identities and ownership is widely broadened. Our bio-information becomes the” paper work” that can allow us to get into the portal of our owned space. The cyborg creature not just show its ability in counting and physical mechanism, but also push our species into a more informatics destination. As we abandon our physicality, what do we really owned as a human being or something else?

        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%;">
Then, what is the space in the future? The cosmo and the virtual land creates a lot of imaginary platforms. After China has successfully sent its first space probe-“Chang’e 5” to the moon and collected the earth from the dark side, I have a sense of feeling that the competition in the space just start its first episode. Who owns the space? How can we say a space in the galaxy which is out of the earth is owned?  As we human beings, fill out and expanding our map is an inherent desire through out our history. The footprint of Armstrong has been on the moon for decades, would that still be a proof or we can see something new with the new technologies?

In the aspect of interaction mechanism, I think it linked to the media so much. What the portal looks like defines what kind of interaction can be. In the Major Studio class I have created passive information exchange like videos and images and also created work that are active. I feel the bidirectional exchange form creates more possibilities and breaks the fourth wall between my work and the audience. I would like to explore this by extending sensations and space boundaries.

The MS1 pushes to think deeper other than a general concept. I have been asked why all the time as I get a result from my research and my work. This is how I would do for my whole studying period and let me think as an artist and a designer.
