I have been talking about some of my concepts in my post mortem section. After reading the article of Research Navigation by Otto von Busch, I'm more confident to push my first project of randomness. In his article, he uses Paul Klee's quote that "art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible." I think in here the visible represents a relationship, a destination and a reality. If we want to explore the new continent as Columbus did, we shall not follow the metaphysical path that already exist in reality. In the contrast, randomness and improvisation is needed for creative people and technologists. How to jump out of the coordinate system and create a new game mode in our living present is my motif. By freeing people's attention from the mobile devices and let them take improvisation, the randomness and the game rules play as an invisible link between people and our virtual data world. An instant feedback is needed that should not be visible. The touch and force feedback becomes my first choice. It can be a pair of shoes that tells people where to go, it can be a wrist band that indicate a random destination on the map. The experience in the random journey provides a lot of space for walkers to trace their "prey" and choose their targets. Creating a sense of conflicting and uncomfortable generates questions. Under the tyranny of digital absorption, human, a creature lives based on our sensations, is not free from our surroundings. The coordinate of life chains us in the destination jail. The sailor cannot perform his improvisation on the sea if the route is fully marked on the map. People need nonsense and a platform, that's where the vague space exist in our calculated physical world. As we are gradually approaching a metaphysical world by adding algorithms onto our existence, the nomadic actions seem more precious.

How do we hide ourselves in the physical world? This is a question existing since the time when human was living in a chaotic stone age. We cannot be perfectly disappeared. Chemical signals will be traced by animals, visual footprints will be presented showing our personal status. It is an eternal problem with us since we were born. We will be labeled as a healthy new born by showing the right weight. We will be labeled as a healthy person as we give a healthy heart beat report. We are not invisible more than ever. The data with us tells stories about ourselves. We are the data, and the data will be with us as a digital trace that can show our actions in the physical space. The methods of erasing trace become unachievable. I would like to raise this question to my audience by create a connection between our physical action with our resulting data. There is a backstage information transformation behind what we see by our eyes. Our action will be transformed into data collected by digital devices that we use everyday. And then the visualization of the data represents our status at that moment. It is an image of ourselves. To leave the image on the ground represents our negligence to leave information to other people by taking any action in the physical surroundings.

What are we facing when we staring at a camera? Do we know who is watching us? Camera vision is a technological power that supervises us and regulates social rules in our society. How does this comes from? We can trace this technology back to our method of documenting what we see. Sundial as a tool to show the time has its unique attribute to us since its simple principle. By connection our unchangeable nature with the conceptual element of time, we can easily tell what time is it through out a day. That is the time we create a link between time and nature by using a tool. Then we have paintings and drawings that can let people to document what are we seeing through the reflection of the sunlight. People can document the objects by using tools. This is the time we can let ourselves recreate a visual image and show this to others. After the chemical method was invented, photography combined the elements of time and paintings let us have the ability to reproduce our physical world more accurately Digital photography gives us the ability to finish an action of creating an image quicker and freely. We can fix the image and fake the effect of the light easily at last. These path is how we generate our ability to document what we can see over this historical line. But camera vision has a profound effect on our society since it not only has the attributes of all the techniques before, but it also can reveal our identities, traits, and invisible information. It is a combination of visual document tool and a virtual library. I want my audience to think about this line of history and what we are facing now with this technology. I want to create a link between camera vision tech and the sundial, to create a three dimensional show. What information does the shadow of the spike on the sundial shows? How simple can the camera vision be by mimicking the principle of a sundial? That would be the exploration part of this project.

    A space is like a living human. There are many different forms of life in its long or short period of life. When it is in youth, its material value will be cherished by people, people will destroy it, use it, crash it ,and cherish it. It seems that its body has infinite vitality. The Great Wall exists in people’s consciousness as a defensive space in its young. People’s expectation of it is that it can exert its due value. And when it reaches a certain level that the age exceeds the critical point at which it can maintain its original value, its life will proceed to the next stage, perhaps towards advanced age, perhaps towards death, or perhaps nirvana rebirth. And this change is determined by the difference between the original value of this space and what people should expect for it. When this contradiction becomes irreconcilable, the space will change at the edge of the critical point, changing its value to meet people's needs. Ancient architecture has become a place of interest and the tourist area to meet the economic needs of the society. The wisteria frame in front of the house disappeared and replaced by the parking lot and children’s slide. The space is constantly changing its life form under the premise of limited space. And the space is death because people have forgotten mercilessly during this conversion. I hope to show the contradiction between people’s expectations of space and the value of this space at the moment. I will throw the idea about the meaning of space for us to the audience. I will transform our inherent thinking toward a space to makes people doubt their own predictions. Why does a classroom have a disco ball in the middle? How can there be a chessboard in the restroom? This is a game and a big thinking challenge for the audience.
