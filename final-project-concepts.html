 I have been talking about some of my concepts in my post mortem section. After reading the article of Research Navigation by Otto von Busch, I'm more confident to push my first project of randomness. In his article, he uses Paul Klee's quote that "art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible." I think in here the visible represents a relationship, a destination and a reality. If we want to explore the new continent as Columbus did, we shall not follow the metaphysical path that already exist in reality. In the contrast, randomness and improvisation is needed for creative people and technologists. 
 How to jump out of the coordinate system and create a new game mode in our living present is my motif. By freeing people's attention from the mobile devices and let them take improvisation, the randomness and the game rules play as an invisible link between people and our vertual data world. An instant feedback is needed that should not be visible. The touch and force feedback becomes my first choice. It can be a pair of shoes that tells people where to go, it can be a wrist band that indicate a random destination on the map. The experience in the random journey 
 provides a lot of space for walkers to trace their "prey" and choose their targets. Creating a sense of conflecting and uncomfortable generates questions. Under the tyranny of digital absorbtion, human, a creature lives based on our sensations, is not free from our surroundings. The coordinate of life chains us in the destination jail. The sailor cannot perform his improvisation on the sea if the route is fully marked on the map. People need nonsense and a platform, that's where the vague space exist in our calculated physical world. As we are gradually approaching a metaphysical world by adding algorithms onto 
          our existance, the nomadic actions seem more precious.

          How do we hide ourselves in the physical world? This is a question existing since the time when human was living in a chaotic stone age. We cannot be perfectly disappeared. Chemical signals will be traced by animals, visual footprints will be presented showing our personal status. It is an eternal problem with us since we were born. We will be labeled as a healthy new born by showing the right weight. We will be labeled as a healthy person as we give a healthy heart beat report. We are not invisible more than ever. The data with us tells stories about ourselves. We are the data, and the data will be with us 
          as a digital trace that can show our actions in the physical space. The methods of erasing trace become unachievable. I would like to raise this question to my audience by create a connection between our physical action with our resulting data. There is a backstage information transformation behind what we see by our eyes. Our action will be transformed into data collected by digital devices that we use everyday. And then the visulization of the data represents our status at that moment. It is an image of ourselves. To leave the image on the ground represents our negligence to leave information to other people 
          by taking any action in the physical surroundings.
