       We have given items a specific value when we use them, and when their value is exhausted, the trash ban becomes their destiny. The first direction is that their material value have been re-transformed into new items for people to use, which consumes a lot of resources and energy. The other direction is that their value is not limited to the value given to use, but can have a new destination. The value of an item is determined by the person who uses it.

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
         A persistent vegetative state (PVS) or post-coma unresponsiveness (PCU) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Today, doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness a syndrome, primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not.
          <br><br>
          The vegetative state is a chronic or long-term condition. This condition differs from a coma: a coma is a state that lacks both awareness and wakefulness. Patients in a vegetative state may have awoken from a coma, but still have not regained awareness. In the vegetative state patients can open their eyelids occasionally and demonstrate sleep-wake cycles, but completely lack cognitive function. The vegetative state is also called a "coma vigil". The chances of regaining awareness diminish considerably as the time spent in the vegetative state increases.
        
          <br>
          <br>
 Most PVS patients are unresponsive to external stimuli and their conditions are associated with different levels of consciousness. Some level of consciousness means a person can still respond, in varying degrees, to stimulation. A person in a coma, however, cannot. In addition, PVS patients often open their eyes in response to feeding, which has to be done by others; they are capable of swallowing, whereas patients in a coma subsist with their eyes closed (Emmett, 1989).
          
          <br>
          <br>
A person that are dignosed as a PVS bassically means he cannot send out signals and communicate with others, while he is still alive. it is the first kind of mixture. 
     <br>
          <br>
          Another mixture is the Dryad. A dryad (/ˈdraɪ.æd/; Greek: Δρυάδες, sing.: Δρυάς) is a tree nymph or tree spirit in Greek mythology. Drys signifies "oak" in Greek, and dryads are specifically the nymphs of oak trees, but the term has come to be used for tree nymphs in general, or human-tree hybrids in fantasy. They were normally considered to be very shy creatures except around the goddess Artemis, who was known to be a friend to most nymphs.
          It is the personate metaphor of human being. A dryad can talk, communicate, move and interact with body movement. That is the perfect model that we can have interaction with. To give human sensory to the nature creatures. To have interaction with them.

From the above examples we have two directions to achive a hyper interaction with our surronding. First is to downgrade our sensories. We can use chemical or electrical methods to communicate with plants by using computers.
          The other method is to endow the human sensory power to the plants. Using the idea of cyborg, we can equip the plant with technical assembles.

<br>
<p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
      I want to push this idea forward. To explore the possibility of our connection with the plant by using vertual reality. As we can see the conditions and status of the plant, we can better communicate with our eco and send out messages to them.
