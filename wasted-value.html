       We have given items a specific value when we use them, and when their value is exhausted, the trash bin becomes their destiny. The first direction is that their material value have been re-transformed into new items for people to use, which consumes a lot of resources and energy. The other direction is that their value is not limited to the value given to use, but can have a new destination. The value of an item is determined by the person who uses it.

     The same thing also happens with our verbal expression. We may speak some nonsense that does not have any meaning to our listeners. For the audience, nonsense is just some wasted words that will only cost their time. In other words, the nonsense is thrown into the garbage bin just like the items that do not have value for them. But can nonsense be like an item and transfer its value into something else?

        <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px; margin-right:20%; margin-left:20%; ">
         Nonsense is a communication, via speech, writing, or any other symbolic system, that lacks any coherent meaning. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with absurdity or the ridiculous. Many poets, novelists and songwriters have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from sense or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a coherent and consistent method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in cryptography regarding separating a signal from noise.
          <br><br>
         The phrase "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" was coined by Noam Chomsky as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with poetic symbolism. The individual words make sense and are arranged according to proper grammatical rules, yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of contradiction and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the kōan "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

 A very interesting example from The Mayor of Scuttleton by Mary Mapes Dodge;<br><br>
          
          The Mayor of Scuttleton burned his nose<br><br>
Trying to warm his copper toes;<br><br>
He lost his money and spoiled his will<br><br>
By signing his name with an icicle quill;<br><br>

A person that are dignosed as a PVS bassically means he cannot send out signals and communicate with others, while he is still alive. it is the first kind of mixture. 
     <br>
          <br>
          Another mixture is the Dryad. A dryad (/ˈdraɪ.æd/; Greek: Δρυάδες, sing.: Δρυάς) is a tree nymph or tree spirit in Greek mythology. Drys signifies "oak" in Greek, and dryads are specifically the nymphs of oak trees, but the term has come to be used for tree nymphs in general, or human-tree hybrids in fantasy. They were normally considered to be very shy creatures except around the goddess Artemis, who was known to be a friend to most nymphs.
          It is the personate metaphor of human being. A dryad can talk, communicate, move and interact with body movement. That is the perfect model that we can have interaction with. To give human sensory to the nature creatures. To have interaction with them.

From the above examples we have two directions to achive a hyper interaction with our surronding. First is to downgrade our sensories. We can use chemical or electrical methods to communicate with plants by using computers.
          The other method is to endow the human sensory power to the plants. Using the idea of cyborg, we can equip the plant with technical assembles.

      I want to push this idea forward. To explore the possibility of our connection with the plant by using vertual reality. As we can see the conditions and status of the plant, we can better communicate with our eco and send out messages to them.
