 What would you feel when you don’t have your smartphone with you when you are exploring the city? You don’t have Twitter, Yelp, Google map, or Wechat, etc. with you to provide location and destination. You are in a lost situation in the city but under a safe circumstance. This is the setting of my day 1 project, the randomness. <br><br>

Four years ago when I was still living in Seattle, I started to pick up my analog camera with me to explore the downtown area. I’m a total outsider at that time since I was not familiar with the people there in Capitol Hill where I heard was the most liberal and dynamic social area around the city.  <br><br>

I and my friend would take turns to decide which direction we will dive into when we met a crossing. We were lost at last. The whole experience was exciting and full of challenges since we made our decisions based on our eyes and experiences to choose which direction would be more worthwhile and interesting to explore. Our sensory were fully open. Even a random flower pot could draw our attention. We were like hunters holding our bows willing to take some exotic animals back home. This exercise helped us understand the people and how the city was put together. We were not looked like visitors who would stare at the phone all the time. We had the chance to talk to local people about their gardens, their grandsons, and their own stories. The city transformed from a visualized data into a living creature. We know stories of how the city survived from the big fire in 1889, how it grew up step by step.  <br><br>

In retrospect, my gains are my experience. I would like to absorb all the information from seeing, smelling, touching, and hearing into my vessel. I was holding my curiosity to explore the space. New things would also persistently provide stimulus to my brain. The whole process was like a game that I would like to push myself to play. I would randomly explore the city in GTA V and drive to nowhere.  <br><br>

But that kind of exploration can’t be exercised all the time. As we are under the tyranny of the smartphone, our freedom of being lost is crashed by the data, and “you may also like”. Our senses and thought are diminished by the tools we made. Can we get lost in such a “dynamic” and multi-layers city today?  <br><br>

In the article “Getting lost is a great way to explore a city – but can you still do it in the age of the smartphone?”, Peter Watts took a method of using social media to help him get lost in a city and take the random path by letting his followers on Twitter to tell him which direction to go. But just like he mentioned below, “The final problem was simply and fairly obvious that staring at a phone while walking, even if this is being done in the service of getting lost, makes it almost impossible to absorb the sights around you and relish the experience it’s all been designed for.” As the interface shining towards our face, our attention would be absorbed by the screen and the main information transaction would be all focused on the virtual platform. Since our vision domains our sense of receiving system, we will lose a lot of sights from our surroundings. To abandon the phone from our lost experience is crucial as long as we are in the city.  <br><br>

So what kind of mechanism should I put in this experience? How do I play with the randomness to lead people? I think these questions are the parts I need to do some testing like a Wizard of OZ exercise. The aim of this random walk is total nonsense, my focus is to enrich the experience of walking and exploring. To get rid of the digital platform, I think there are two directions to help us make decisions by “blinding” our eyes and erasing the destination. First, space can contribute to the process. People can be lead by signs and color to make their own game rules. The signs need to be arbitrary like color or animals. It is a good way to draw attention back to the streets, while the workload and efforts need to be taken into account. The other direction is just like the example of “vibrating super shoes tell you where to walk”. By emitting feedback that is not visualized is worth to explore. I can try physical feedbacks, sound, and smell feedbacks to execute the information transmission part. As we are walking, the map is invisible but it is still running backstage. When we trigger some gimmicks, the information would send a signal to us. <br><br>

I like to think of this project as a counter experiment as to what our life today. We embrace the technology as a part of our tentacles to contact with our surroundings. We become our god as a mixture of data and the physical body. We are cyborgs, we are Heracles. This arrogant self-recognition leads us to miss the beauty of our life. What would the situation changes if we let fate and destination decide for us? Would we think differently when we walk through the streets? <br><br>

As an artist, I like to deliver audience problems. Challenging common sense and direct thinking logic is usually my way of working. I will hit a straight punch to the audience like the day1 and day2 projects. I would present the ignored details in an intuitive form in front of the audience. Starting from the opposite side of things, let the audience's feelings at the moment collide and impact with the usual thinking logic to generate problems. In this group of 7in7 projects, my idea is mainly focusing on the critical aspects of technology in Design for This Century and Critical Computation. Critical thinking about ourselves and our views on technology is my motivation to carry on this set of projects. At our current level of technology, The retrospective review can better reflect the current situation of our contemporary social issues, and can also arouse the audience's resonance with the work.<br><br>

For the second day’s project, physical trace, I think I can present the way of performance in a more explicitly manner. The data collection and data visualization I want to show is easier to see. The norm is a mirror, which will show us the actual data problem in today's world and presents the audience in the opposite form. Making the distance between the two endpoints and the norm line equal is what I am thinking. The series of experiments I have done on ice is a clear definition of the edges and boundaries. I want to establish a connection between the data and our physical trace. This can lead people to think smoothly and enter the most concentrated contradiction of the entire work. That is, our data traces are as hard as to erase our physical traces. And this kind of information leaking will make us more at a loss. Rather than hiding our data, I think putting the situation out on the table is more important. This project is not a tutorial but a critical work. Hito Steyerl's artwork is in a humorous expression, and the calm tone presented a thoughtful problem to the audience. I learned a lot from it. Not only the way she used technology itself to criticize technology but also her choice in the presentation also fascinated me. It’s worth learning how to compare humans with pixels in the form of an analogy. But I want to take this concept one step further. I will let the audience feel the existence of this contradiction and raise problems. At this time, the media is more than just a visual representation of the action trajectory or the visualize of the action trace. It can be a pair of shoes that are spreading data or a billboard that constantly exposes its location. The choice of media also requires me to experiment and iterate.<br><br>

Putting the theme aside, I will also think about the meaning of the medium itself and the clones of other mediums. In our human science and technology tree, there are many treasures that we have forgotten or ignored. And the third project is going on to explore this issue. The idea of ​​this project is not perfect. I think there is still a lot of room to push forward. The way of recording shadows may be a medium for other themes. The depicted object is the shell or the appearance, the shadow, on the contrary, is the meaning behind it. What kind of content is fitting for this media can be one of my goals in promoting this project. Also, it is another direction to think about the medium alone. We went from recording the trajectory of time to using paintings to record the reflection of light and then using cameras to integrate these elements to form the history of our technological development. Now, computers can replace us to do all these calculations and operations. Computer vision further records our information. Can I connect different methods on this single timeline to make this concept three-dimensional? Maybe concepts of computer vision can be reflected on the sundial, on the contrary, the simple interactive form of the sundial can also simplify our existing technological methods. From this hybrid form, the audience will think about our technological development from a historical perspective and reflect on our existing tech means. Does it separate us from nature? I want to show my project in a neutral form, just like a pedestrian standing on a single-plank bridge, making people doubt the concept and the status quo at both ends of history.<br><br>

I like the work of Australian artist Stelarc. The project that fascinates me most is The Third Hand, 1980. He used the most advanced technology at the time to show the hybrid form of man and machine. Get rid of the vagueness of science fiction, he installed a real mechanical arm on his physical arm and show the conflict in front of the audience in the most visually stunning way. This shocking level was unforgettable at the time. Use the latest and greatest advanced technology is a good way to ask questions. Another artist Orlan followed the same method. Her work Omnipresence (1993) shocked me the most. She regards herself as a part of the artwork, by recording what she is doing during the process of plastic surgery and encourages the viewer to think critically about how women's bodies historically have been the passive objects of science and medicine. Through the most advanced technology, she clearly expresses the problems that have always existed in this society.<br><br>

My 5th and 6th projects also want to follow their approach to a certain extent. But the transformation of the physical body may be too radical. I am thinking about the transformation range may be the space around us or the life similar to our body. Just like what Eduardo Kac did to rabbits in his work GFP Bunny, 2000, our living space may also be given a data life by us. This standard for defining life and death may be the same as that of us humans, by measuring body temperature and observing vital signs. One possible attempt is that I can connect the definition of space with our history in the form of a timeline so that the concept becomes three-dimensional. For example, the living existence of the ancient Roman Colosseum and his current status. Is there an invisible line between meanings? What is the difference between our definition of space in the past and the present? Another direction is thinking about specific locations. Just like the World War II monument in Berlin, Germany. What does the special historical significance of this space have? Can its vitality be measured by us? What kind of space do I want to explore is an in-depth question I need to think about. The technology to measure space is also one of the things I need to study.<br><br>

The sixth project is an exploration of the cyborg of plants. It has a very close connection with biotechnology. After information sizing, can we break the barriers between different ecosystems? This may be something viewers want to think about later.<br><br>

The exploration of computer language is also a topic that I am interested in these projects. In the undergraduate study, the linguistic course has made me very interested in the structure and semantics of the human language. I think I can take the nature of human language to create a kind of mashup with computer language. Anna Garbier's work is very inspiring for me. I like her concept of Toast2word (V0) very much. It is like a game that transforms monotonous text information into very vivid Visualization. I can feel the doubt about this language difference.<br><br>

This process of reflection is very important to me. During the process of the project, I didn’t have so many in-depth views on my themes and thinking. It is also difficult to position myself in the area of the same topic. Although some of the ideas of the project need to be further advanced and refined, overall, I find that my directions and works are more inclined to locate in the fuzzy space and trigger the audience’s thinking. I like to continue my project in this direction advance.<br><br>
